About
=====

This project aims to provide utilities which are not usually provided by setups
which don't use "standard" desktop environments such as GNOME, KDE, XFCE, and
others. These utilities include DBus-aware session daemons which watch for
signals to lock the screen, ask for authorization, etc.
